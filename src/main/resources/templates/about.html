                            If you haven’t heard of cloud computing, where have
                            you been?

                            Seriously, not many people know about this, and
                            those who do are quite confused about it. For good
                            reason that I will get to in a moment.

                            But there’s a service I came across that seems like
                            a good way to get those business cards thrust at you
                            at a recent conference or event saved on a remote
                            server to be accessible anywhere. It’s called Cloud
                            Contacts.

                            Sounds a nifty thing, since you ship them a stack of
                            cards ina prepaid envelope, they scan it and save it
                            in formats that you can suck into Gmail, Yahoo or
                            Outlook. Except that it strikes me as a pricey way
                            to go ($29.95 for 100 cards, $69.95 for 300)
                            considering that (a) you could type that information
                            yourself on a plane, say, or pay someone to do it if
                            you’re that lazy (b) You could buy yourself a card
                            reader for the price of getting them to scan 500
                            business cards.

                            For all its geekiness, cloud computing at its basic
                            level is nothing flashy or new. If you have a Yahoo
                            or Gmail account, all your saved email, your
                            contacts and folders exist in the cloud, so to
                            speak. If you save your files to an online storage
                            service like Dropboks.com, those files are basically
                            in another cloud. Heck, your Facebook profile exists
                            in a cloud as does your Plaxo contacts. To me it’s
                            another name for what has become the third place
                            where we work â€” after the PC and the mobile
                            device.

                            And because it is so many things we know of and
                            didn’t realize -there are many more dimensions to it
                            â€” it confuses us.
